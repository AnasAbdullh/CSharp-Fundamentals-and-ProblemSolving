# C# Fundamentals and Problem Solving

This repository is a learning journey through the C# programming language, blending core concepts with hands-on problem-solving using real-world challenges from platforms like Codeforces and UVa.

## What's Inside?

### C# Core Concepts
- `AbstractAndInterFace.cs` – Abstract classes and interfaces
- `Delegate.cs`, `Event.cs`, `AnonymousType.cs` – Delegates, events, and anonymous types
- `Reflection.cs`, `Enum.cs`, `NestedClass.cs` – Advanced language features
- `OverloadingOperator.cs`, `Indexers.cs`, `property.cs`, `constructor.cs` – OOP essentials
- `Enumerators_Iterators_ienumerator_ienumerable_icomparable.cs` – Collections and iteration
- `Finalizer_Destructor_GarbageCollection.cs` – Memory management
- `Field_Constant.cs`, `Casting_Type.cs`, `Methods.cs`, `Expressions.cs` – Language basics

### Problem Solving (Competitive Programming)
- Codeforces-style challenges:
  - `A.FreeIceCream.cs`, `A.Juicer.cs`, `Beautiful_Matrix.cs`, `AntonAndDanik.cs`, etc.
  - Covers logic, math, arrays, strings, and more
- UVa problems:
  - `UVA10106.cs` – Big integer multiplication
  - `UVA408.cs` – Rotation cipher check

### Hybrid Examples
- Applying C# features directly within problem-solving context.
- Building understanding of both syntax and algorithmic thinking.

## Why This Repository?

To:
- Build strong C# fundamentals.
- Improve problem-solving through practical challenges.
- Learn how to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK installed (`dotnet --version`)
- C# 8.0 or higher recommended

## How to Run

To compile and run a file:

```bash
dotnet new console -n TempApp
cd TempApp
# Replace Program.cs with any desired file
cp ../path/to/File.cs Program.cs
dotnet run
